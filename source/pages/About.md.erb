# About Me

> My work explores the relationship between acquired synesthesia and multimedia experiences.
>
> With influences as diverse as Camus and John Cage, new synergies are crafted from both explicit and implicit textures.
>
> Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of the mind. What starts out as vision soon becomes debased into a dialectic of lust, leaving only a sense of decadence and the chance of a new synthesis.
>
> As temporal forms become clarified through emergent and diverse practice, the viewer is left with a statement of the limits of our era.
