# Biography

I am a software developer at [Mensia Technologies](http://mensiatech.com) working on software solutions for EEG signal processing.

[My Bitbucket Profile](https://bitbucket.org/yoz-y)

Formerly I have worked at Inria Rennes research laboratory as developer and later lead software engineer of the OpenViBE BCI platform. During my stay at Inria I have represented OpenViBE at occasions such as BCI Meeting 2013 (California, USA) or Science Festival (Göteborg, Sweden). Previously I have worked for a subsidiary of Vinci company.

Some of my work involves doing science, so far I have two publications :

**Legény, J.**, Viciana Abad, R. & Lécuyer A., "Navigating in Virtual Worlds Using a Self-Paced SSVEP-Based Brain-Compter Interface with Integrated Stimulation and Real-Time Feedback", *Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments*, 20, pp. 529--544, (2011)
