# About Me

> My work explores the relationship between acquired synesthesia and multimedia
> experiences.
>
> With influences as diverse as Camus and John Cage, new synergies are crafted
> from both explicit and implicit textures.
>
> Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of
> the mind. What starts out as vision soon becomes debased into a dialectic of
> lust, leaving only a sense of decadence and the chance of a new synthesis.
>
> As temporal forms become clarified through emergent and diverse practice, the
> viewer is left with a statement of the limits of our era.

## Bio

I am a software developer at [Mensia Technologies](http://mensiatech.com)
working on software solutions for EEG signal processing. Mostly, I specialize
in C++ development.

## Research

Some of my work involves doing science, so far I have two publications :

**Legény, J.**, Viciana Abad, R. & Lécuyer A., "Navigating in Virtual Worlds
Using a Self-Paced SSVEP-Based Brain-Compter Interface with Integrated
Stimulation and Real-Time Feedback", *Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual
Environments*, 20, pp. 529--544, (2011)
