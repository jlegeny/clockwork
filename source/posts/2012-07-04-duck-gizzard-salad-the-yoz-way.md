Since the last recipe was for a burger, let us make something healthier. Like a
salad. However let us make it tasty as well, like by adding a pint of fat.

## Ingredients

 1. Mesclun
 2. Duck gizzards
 3. Tomatoes
 4. VÃ¤sterbottensost (Swedish cheese)
 5. Cashew nuts
 6. Salt
 7. Pepper

## Preparation of ingredients

Wash the salad, dice the tomatoes (wash them first, eh). Dice the cheese.

If your duck needs to be heated in bain-marie do so. Cut the meat to smaller
pieces (keep the fat).

## Cooking

Heat a frying pan. Use the fat from the duck to grease it. Throw the duck and
cashew nuts in. Salt, pepper and stir for a bit.

Take a salad bowl and throw everything in. Mix vigorously.

## Afterword

Making salad is easy. Just take anything you have in the fridge and throw it
into a bowl. The more colors the better.
