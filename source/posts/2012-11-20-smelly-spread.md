Why smelly? Because your breath after eating this will be comparable to that of a thousand years old dragon. But it is well worth it. The recipe is dead simple as well. 

### Ingredients

![ingredients]

1.  Sardines in oil (any oil as long as it is not motor oil)
2.  Butter
3.  Onions

### Preparation 

Simple as promised: Just put the fish into a bowl, add a few slices of butter and the diced onions. Then furiously mix the thing until it vaguely looks like something spreadable on a bread. Job's done!

### And yet ...

Making the spread is simple, the difficult part is to serve it right and arrange the plate so it will have some bling to it. I did not try this time, but somedays I'll update this with some better presentation.
