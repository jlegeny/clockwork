When Leader Price discontinued my preferred chili sauce I was angry and very
sad. Oddly enough, Intermarché did the same and removed chili from their
selection of Claude Léger sauces. Obviously there is no market for chili in
France. What is done is done and we, cheap chili lovers, are now stuck with the
Uncle Ben's crap.

But let us not fall into despair, there is a way to save this non-perishable
canned (bottled?) food franchise. The recipe is extremely simple, take a bottle
of Uncle Ben's chili sauce, add in a can of tomato paste and an appropriate
amount of Sriracha sauce. And, voilà, ready to cook and serve. Preferably with
bacon and rice.
