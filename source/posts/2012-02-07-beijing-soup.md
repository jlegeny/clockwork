I've been searching for this recipe for quite a long time. Finally I got hold of it thanks to my brother. And due to popular demand here is the recipe complete for one of the best soups out there. So... without further delays.

## Ingredients

	1. One whole chicken
	2. Shiitake mushrooms (dried)
	3. Black mushrooms (dried)
	4. A carrot
	5. Bamboo sprouts
	6. Two eggs
	7. Soy sauce
	8. Rice vinegar
	9. Sambala sauce
	10. Tapioca starch
	11. Salt
	12. Whole black pepper
	13. Chicken bouillon cube

## Preparation of ingredients

*Hint* : I recommend reading the whole recipe first as some of the steps can be
done at the same time.

It is best to begin by dipping the mushrooms in warm water (shiitake and black
mushrooms separately) as it takes about 30 minutes for them to soak well. The
longer the better. After they have soaked cut the shiitake to small pieces.

Cut off the legs and breasts of the chicken, put them aside we will not be
needing them for this meal.

Clean the carrot and cut it to small pieces. Cut the bamboo sprouts as well.

Crack the two eggs into a bowl and scramble them.

## Cooking

Heat about 1.5L of water, salt it, put in a dozen of grains of the whole pepper
and put the chicken inside. Cook for about 45 minutes.

Take the chicken out and put the bouillon cube as well as the mushrooms (both),
carrots and bamboo sprouts inside.

Cut off all of the meat from the bones of the chicken and put it back into the
soup (the meat, not the bones).

Cook for about ten minutes, then add two table spoons of vinegar, three table
spoons of soy sauce and two spoonfuls of Sambal sauce (or more, if you wish the
soup to be more spicy).

Cook for another 10 minutes, afterwards add in the eggs and stir well. Finally
prepare two spoons of tapioca starch in a bowl - add a bit of water and mix
until all of the starch has diluted. Then add the mix to the soup. Cook for
about 10 minutes and you are done.

## Afterword

The soup is to be eaten very hot. If you do not have chicken you can use more
bouillon cubes instead (still, it is much better with real meat).
