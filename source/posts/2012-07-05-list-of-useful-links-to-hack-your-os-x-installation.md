This is more of a social bookmark than a full article. OS X is pretty neat but
the ever-present philosophy of "our way of doing it is the right way" can be
frustrating from time to time. Since I do not really like the trend of
paraphrasing already written articles I will just dump a bunch of links here
and say what I used them for.

[Fix Home and End keys behaviour][ln-home-end]

Home and End keys should go to the beginning and end of the line you are on
while editing. In OS X they scroll to the top and the bottom of the current
document, which is retarded.

[A ton of useful hidden settings][ln-hidden]

I like keyboard repeat. Also I like to be able to copy text from QuickLook.

[Use QuickLook from the terminal][ln-ql-terminal]

I use this for my side-project of making Midnight Commander actually usable on
OS X. So far I did not have time to really invest into it.
