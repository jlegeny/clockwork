The current Mac Mini has many uses and most of them are not for desktop users.
So, what would you want to use a small “cheap” computer running macOS for?

- A media center connected to a TV
- A Facebook machine with iTunes music on it
- A build/test server for developers
- A server that one can put into a rack (like at Mac Mini Colo)

None of these things need a x86 processor.

I bet that whatever replaces the Mac Mini will be the first ARM based Mac. And
it will be glorious.
