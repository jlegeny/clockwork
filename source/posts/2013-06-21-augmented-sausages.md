> My sausages are augmented

As I came home, craving for some chowder, I was wondering what to cook. I
wanted to finish some meat from earlier in my fridge but had to make decisions.
Do I cook sausages, or do I grill some bacon?

Finally I have decided to do both.

With a bit of cayenne and cheese you got yourself a good healthy dinner. Oh,
and for vitamins grill it in some pig fat.
