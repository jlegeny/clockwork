*Last update: 2013-06-29 for Qt Creator 2.7.1*

Staring at long lines of code can get frustrating. Even more so if the said
lines have ugly eye-hurting colors. I have been using the beautiful MacVim
theme in Vim for some time now and it is quite awesome. However QtCreator,
which I [use for OpenViBE development][1], lacks such a theme. This problem was
easily fixed though. Here is a screenshot of a theme I have created and,
because of the lack of creativity, named *Gulf*:
