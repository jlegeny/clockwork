With the confinement I am realising that I have fewer hobbies than I thought. Also it turns out I don't like watching TV shows as much.

I have started preparing several articles on this blog in advance, hopefully I'll be able to keep a more steady writing cadence. At least until the ordeal lasts.

Stay safe. Stay home.
