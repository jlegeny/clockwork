Over at the [DOS Games Club][dgc] we have played six small games[^games] during the cold month of December. I have suggested playing [UGH!][ugh] and joined Florian, Martijn, Mike, Philipp and Tim on the [25<sup>th</sup> episode][dgc-25].

In February we will be operating on unfortunate patients in the [Life & Death][lad].
