Any self-respected hipster photographer must provide his share of vintage
photos with helvetica captions. In order to make life easier for people using
the Greatest Image Manipulation Programâ„¢ I have made a script which does the
hard part. The provided script is based on [this tutorial][gimpology-tutorial].
Download the script and put it into your `${HOME}/.gimp/scripts` folder (or its
equivalent on your system).
