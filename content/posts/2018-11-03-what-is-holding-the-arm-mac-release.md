The event held on the 30th of October solidified the idea roaming the Internet since a few years: ARM Macs are coming, and they are coming _soon_. [A-series chips have caught up to all but the best Intel mobile chips][geekbench], so why is there an Intel processor inside the new _MacBook Air_?

[geekbench]: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/10611310?baseline=10581888 "A12X vs 6-core Intel Core i7-8850H"

I have a theory: A-series chips are not powerful enough–but in an unapparent way. 

In my previous article I have predicted that Apple would:

1. Rename the current _MacBook_ to _MacBook Air_.
2. Discontinue the _13″ MacBook Pro without TouchBar_.
3. Introduce a new, cheaper, 13″ computer called _MacBook_.

This did not happen as predicted. What was announced is a new _MacBook Air_, which is a 13" version of the current MacBook. Other laptops in the _MacBook_ line were untouched.

What I think will happen _next_ year is:

1. Apple will introduce a new _12" MacBook Air_ and "discontinue"[^1] the _MacBook_ line.
2. Apple will introduce a new _13" MacBook with Apple ARM chip_[^2].

[^1]: In today's Apple's philosophy this means that it will continue to be sold, maybe with lower price.
[^2]: I expect this name to be something unexpected, what about an "Apple Mac"?

But herein lies the problem. Which chip would go in? If Apple took the A12X processor from the current iPad Pro and added a bit of RAM, this setup would breathe at the neck of the current _15" MacBook Pro with Touchbar_[^fan]. This would have serious implications for the Pro line as the only differentiator would be the software they can use.

In order to offer compelling Pro hardware, Apple needs to make a beefier A-series chip. One that would give even the Intel desktop chips a run for their money.

[^fan]: If they added active cooling, I would bet that it could run circles around a 45watt 4-core Intel processor.
