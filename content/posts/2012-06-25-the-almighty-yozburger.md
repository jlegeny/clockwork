Hunger strikes again! And best remedy for hunger is food! And best food is...
burgers!

## Ingredients

Possibilities are endless but decisions have to be made. Usually I put this
into a burger, but feel free to add whatever you like.

1.  Hamburger bun (big one)
2.  Beef burger
3.  Bacon
4.  Cheddar cheese
5.  Egg
6.  Tomato
7.  Onion
8.  Lettuce (or Chinese cabbage)
9.  Salt
10. Pepper
11. Brown sugar
12. Pork fat

## Preparation of ingredients

Slice the onion to stripes. Slice tomatoes to circular slices. Cut the lettuce
to smaller leaves.

## Cooking

Start of by melting the fat on a pan. Put the bacon in and pour brown sugar
over it to make candied bacon.

Remove the bacon, salt and pepper the burger and put it on the pan (use the
same pan for everything). When the steak is almost done (rare) put the onions
and tomato and lettuce in. Also start frying the egg (and salt it a bit). It is
important to cook the onions, lettuce and tomato in the same oil as the bacon
and the burger. If you do not have enough place to put everything into the pan
then cook what you must after you have removed the burger.

Start assembling the burger. From bottom I usually do : bun, cheese, onions,
tomato, burger, cheese, onions, tomato, lettuce, egg, bun. Refer to the diagram
for more precise information.

Secret knack : after I finish assembling the burger, just before putting the
egg in I pour all of the oil from the pan into the burger. This serves as the
best sauce you will ever have and this way you will avoid using unhealthy
sauces like ketchup or mayo.

## Final word

No words are necessary, just look at the beauty!
