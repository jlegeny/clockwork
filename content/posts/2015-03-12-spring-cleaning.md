I've decided to simplify the website's source. I went from 20 SCSS files to one. My goal is to serve no cruft. I've gone through all superfluous classes (bye bye clearfix). The grid is gone in favour of flex.

I've added my GitHub page to social links and changed the icons to SVG.

Next step is moving Gulf to GitHub, getting rid of jQuery and finally; writing.
