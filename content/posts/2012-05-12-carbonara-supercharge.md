When you are dying of hunger you need to swallow something with a lot of
calories of all sorts (just in case), and you need to do it fast. This is a ten
minute recipe for delicious pasta with enough fat to give you a minor
heart-attack.

Today we are cooking a spinoff of spaghetti (or whatever, all pasta tastes the
same) carbonara.

## Ingredients

![ingredients]


You should always have these around in your house anyways, but maybe you will
have to add 10 minutes for shopping

 1. Pasta (I use spaghetti or penne)
 2. Sliced bacon
 3. Liquid cream (or any other, actually)
 4. Parmesan cheese
 5. Emmental cheese
 6. Canned sliced mushrooms
 7. Egg
 8. Onion
 9. Bonus: White Wine

## Preparation of ingredients

Nada. Well, open the can of mushrooms at least. Oh, and dice the onion.

## Cooking

Depending on your pasta you will have to start cooking it at some random moment
during the cooking of the sauce. Or you can just cook it after sauce is ready,
it can wait, the pasta can not.

Start by frying the onions in a pan. Once they are ready put in the bacon. Cook
until the bacon changes colour and add sliced mushrooms. Cook for like a minute
and then add some cream. Afterwards add some cheese (either or both), not too
much, and cook until it disolves. If you are rich enough add a spoonful or two
of white wine into the mix now. Repeat the previous step until you think you
have enough cheese in the mix. Cook for a bit. Now put in the egg and stirr
furiously.

Voil√†! Dinner is ready.
