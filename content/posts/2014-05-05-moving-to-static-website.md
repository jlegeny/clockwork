So I have jumped on the bandwagon and decided to generate my website
statically[^fmdm]. For you, it basically means that the site will be a lot
faster. For me, I can finally write stuff in markdown only and not worry that
some web-editor will butcher it.

[^fmdm]: I am using the [Middleman][mdm] with a modified [Bones][bones] theme

[mdm]: http://middlemanapp.com
[bones]: http://themble.com/bones/

Also, the search field has disappeared, but I am looking for a different
option. Either Google custom search or Bing. I will see.

Ciao
