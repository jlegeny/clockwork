Today, my friends at [DOS Game Club][dgc] released a [new episode of the podcast][dgc-34]. I was one of the guests and together with Martijn, Tyler and Matthew we sat for a long chat about an old-time classic: UFO: Enemy Unknown, published by Microprose. In North America this game is known as X-Com: UFO Defense.

This game started a long series of games in all genres and is one of the longest going series.

Enjoy!
