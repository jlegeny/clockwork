The Mac keyboard layout is weird. Some choices Apple made when designing it are
good but some of them really come from outer space. Why would anybody need a ±
symbol on his keyboard is beyond me. Luckily Ukelele software provides an
acceptable solution.

Personally I use U.S. Extended layout for almost everything. The only time I
switch is when I have a very lengthy french text to write. (Speaking of which,
why does french layout have a  character directly on the keyboard? Just how
often would anybody use that?). So, in order to keep the layout consistent with
other keyboards I have made a U.S. Extended+ version which changes flips the
**§±** and **`~** keys around.
