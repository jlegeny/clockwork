A new episode of [Dos Game Club podcast][dgc-22] was released today. This
22<sup>nd</sup> instalment is about a legendary game: The Secret of Monkey
Island.

I have been fortunate to be able to join Martijn, Florian, Mike, Philipp and
Esko to discuss this great game during an epic 3 hour session. If you enjoy
retro gaming and especially DOS games, give this podcast a try!

Every month we select a different game to play and discuss on the forums and
IRC. Martijn and Florian then invite a few guests do discuss the episode and
record a podcast session.
