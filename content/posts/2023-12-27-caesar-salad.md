Years ago there was this iPad app called "The Best Ceasar", some bloke thought it was a good idea to make one whole app just about one recipe... he was right. The app is long gone but here is the gist of the recipe as far as I remember it.



# Dressing

## Ingredients

1. Anchovies
2. Garlic
3. Worcestershire Sauce
4. Red Wine Vinegar
5. Olive Oil
6. Parmesan Cheese
7. Salt
8. Pepper

## Preparation

1. Smash the anchovies in a bowl into a fine paste. 
2. Press in 3 cloves of garlic.
3. Add a dash of olive oil (depending on how oily your anchovies are).
4. Add a table spoon of Worcestershire sauce.
5. Add a table spoon of red wine vinegar.
6. Add salt and pepper to taste.
7. Mix it all together.
8. Add in parmesan to obtain a thick-ish dressing.

# Croutons

## Ingredients

1. Bread
2. Olive Oil
3. Garlic

## Preparation

My current go-to recipe is to:

1. Press garlic into a bowl of olive oil.
2. Baste bread slices with the garlic oil.
3. Put the slices in an oven until crispy.
4. Cut the toasted bread into croutons.

# Chicken

## Ingredients

1. Chicken Breast
2. Salt
3. Pepper
4. Olive Oil

## Preparation

If the chicken breast is thicker than about 15mm, cut it in half (to make it thinner).

1. Pre-heat the oven to 200ºC (or 180 with fan on).
1. Salt and pepper the chicken.
2. Put some olive oil in a pan and heat it at high temperature.
3. Sear the chicken on all sides until golden on the outside.
4. Put the chicken in the oven, cook until the inner temperature is a bit under 75ºC.
5. Dice the chicken.

# Serving

Wash and dry (as much as you can) a couple of heads of romaine lettuce. Add the dressing and toss it properly. Mix in the chicken and croutons, toss it again, sprinkle with more grated parmesan.
