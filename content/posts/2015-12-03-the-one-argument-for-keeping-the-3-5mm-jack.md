The rumour about Apple removing the 3.5mm jack in the future iPhone has wreaked
havoc around the Internet. There are several arguments for and against it, but I
think there is only one that is valid: it would make it impossible to create
accessories for iPhone without going through the MFI process.

Case in point, Apple has recently featured this application in their
advert "Ridiculously Powerful".

This application would probably never exist without the possibility to
leverage a cheap and universal interface with the device.
