Have you ever thought you might be liking too much stuff on Facebook? Have you
ever thought that it might be such an important issue that you need to stop
doing it? And write about it on a popular tech website?

Well, some people have, as written in [this article][1]. Seriously, if people
do not have a real problem to cope with they will find one. If we have a job, a
home, and a decent life let us complain about how we must do stuff that did not
even exist a few years ago.

Really? What kind of obligation do you have to random people on the Internet?
Luckily Facebook does not have (yet) a feature showing you who read your posts
like they have for chat.
