Just now I wanted to publish a new version of my app to testers. This is to be done on the iTunes connect website. I only had my phone, but according to Steve "iOS has full web experience" so this should not be a problem. 

However, iTunes connect does not work exactly well on mobile. This is because the zoom level of the page is fixed on the "background" while the dialogs are in front. The result is that the button _Submit_ is inaccessible. 

After some amount of looking for a solution I have found several bookmarklets that should unlock the zoom. None of them worked. So I made my own solution. 

Bookmark this page in Safari and change its URL to this:

```js
javascript:(function(){document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].style.zoom =0.5;})()
```

Then, on a page which has elements outside of the viewport, launch the bookmark from the bookmark menu. The page will be twice as small, but more of it will fit!
