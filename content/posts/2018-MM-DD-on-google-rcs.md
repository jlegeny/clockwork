You might have seen that Google has managed to herd device manufacturers and telcos to support a new standard for messaging: RCS[^1]. After a rather long [string of failures in messaging space][google-messaging] one may be quite skeptical on whether this will get adopted or not.

In my opinion the RCS will be adopted, and I'll go even further and say that it will eat shares from all other messaging platforms with the exception of iMessage.

## Why iMessage succeeded 

In order to understand why RCS will succeed, we need to look at iMessage. I admit that when it first launched I did not see why would anybody use it. I already had a means to communicate with all of my family and friends, through Skype, Hangouts, Facebook, IRC... I had a preferred method with everybody. Also, I did not use SMS (or so I thought).

But, the fact is that I did use SMS, albeit very sporadically. At that time I only knew very few people who had iPhones but as that number grew, so did the amount of blue bubbles. And once I got the blue bubble, I realized that I can move this contact off a specific platform. iMessage worked great. It was not better than other platforms such as WhatsApp, but it was there whether I liked it or not.

And it had a massive advantage for which I did not care at the moment: end to end encryption. This was a bonus, but like me, millions of others suddenly got access to secure communication.

Now Google is trying very hard to roll the civilisation back and they will most probably succeed.

## Why will RCS succeed

The most valuable part of each social network is, well, the network. Ever since Twitter and Facebook have closed the pipes, new social networks tried to piggy back on the phones contact list to create a rudimentary graph of connections. Most messaging services are also tied to a phone number[^tied-to-pn].

[^tied-to-pn]: As far as I know, WhatsApp, WeChat, Allo all need a phone number to work.

On android, RCS will basically replace the SMS on supported devices and carriers. This means, that whether you like it or not, you will get all of the good features of the protocol. Slowly, as people upgrade, they will discover that they do not actually need to have, let's say, WhatsApp installed for "that one person" as there is a large probability that the said person has an Android headset and, more importantly, you have this person in your contacts. One by one, such private tunnels will be replaced by RCS.

One cannot blame the users, nobody wants to have a folder full of instant messaging apps, each of which is used only to communicate with one person. Slowly but surely, people will realize that the "new SMS" is good enough and they will abandon Whats App and the like.
