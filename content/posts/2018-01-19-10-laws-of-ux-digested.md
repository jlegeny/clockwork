After reading the article on [10 Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) and the associated comments on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16185118), I have decided to try a shot at reformatting the page to a more legible format. In the form of a blog post—because I do not think that every idea on the internet needs its own domain.

I provide my own interpretation of the laws in the titles, they are not in the original article.

### 1. If a function needs to be accessed often and/or quickly, make the button big

> The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
> 
> -- Paul Fitts

[Fitt's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law)

### 2. Only provide choices when a good default does not exist

> The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
>
> -- William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman

[Hick's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law)

### 3. Respect the platform's conventions and interface guidelines

> Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
>
> -- Jakob Nielsen

[Jakob's Law on Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/jakobs-law-internet-ux/)

### 4. Do not stuff too much detail into a small space

> Law of Prägnanz:
>
> _People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us._

[The Laws of Figure/Ground, Prägnanz, Closure, and Common Fate on Interaction Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-laws-of-figure-ground-praegnanz-closure-and-common-fate-gestalt-principles-3)

### 5. Put actions that do similar things together

> Law of Proximity:
>
> _Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together._

_N.B.: The recent [missile alert fiasco](https://twitter.com/CivilBeat/status/953127542050795520) is a good example of why this is important_

### 6. Reduce the number of things your users have to remember 

> The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
> 
> -- George Miller

[Miller's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%27s_law)

### 7. Make tasks short, simple and with set deadlines

> Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.
> 
> -- Cyril Northcote Parkinson

[Parkinson's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)

### 8. Put the important things at the beginning or at the end

> _Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series._

[Serial Position Effect on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect)

### 9. Removing features from your product may result in users not being able to achieve some goals

> _Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced._

[Larry Tesler's Law of Conservation of Complexity on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity)

### 10. Make the most important thing stand out

> _The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered._

[Von Restorff Effect on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Restorff_effect)

Alternatively: If you want to stand out from competition, find a feature which is always the same and make it different.

### Bonus law

> Do not put a leading zero on numbers that do not have to be aligned.
