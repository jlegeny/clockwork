Just a thought I got after listening to the Golden Cortex episode. There is no perfect e-mail application because everybody's definition of perfect is different.

Thus, to have a perfect app you need to have a lot of solutions to choose from. Problems such as note taking or shopping list making are simple. Even with large competition, you can take the risk and develop a new approach. However, e-mail is complicated, which means that the application would have to be complex. It would be costly to develop and thus would have to be expensive, reducing the pool of potential clients.

Complex problem will only have good enough[^perfection] solutions because making a perfect solution would not be economically viable.

[^perfection]: It is important to note that perfection is not additive. If your application has every feature under the sun it means it will be less than desirable to many.
