After the whole dung-storm about price fixing of ebooks at Apple I wanted to
add my own rant.

When digital music came out CD publishers were unhappy; why? Because digital
download prices were much lower that CD prices, people did not have to lift
their ass of their couch and had the music right away.

What do we get with digital downloaded books? This:

First to clarify: the book currently runs a $10 discount on the paperback
edition, normally it sells for $29.99. Regardless though, how is it more
convenient to get the book for more in digital format than a physical copy? No
matter the shipping cost you still save money on getting a hardcover. And let
us not even mention the used book for $0.01â€¦

Note: Apple does not sell this book as an iBook, the book in question is *The
inmates are running the asylum* by Alan Cooper
