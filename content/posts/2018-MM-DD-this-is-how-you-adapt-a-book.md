I really liked the movie [Ready Player One][imdb-rpo], I have also read [the book][apple-books-rpo] before. If you do not wish to get spoiled on either, watch the movie and read the book before moving on.

A lot of people seem to be angry at the fact that the movie has surprisingly few things in common with the book. It keeps the world, the characters and the general plot line, but then completely changes the nature of the challenges and the relationships between characters.

## More action

Some changes were to be expected, and mostly stem from the fact that the whole book needed to fit in a single movie. This is actually a great idea from the start because we know that when one stretches a rather short book into three long movies [disaster happens][imdb-hobbit]. This means that a lot of stuff will have to be cut. And Ready Player One has a lot of stuff that can be cut.

For one, the book starts with a quite long exposure of why the first key was not foundâ€“nobody knows where to even begin. In the movie we have the pleasure to enjoy a visually stunning race full of destruction. A perfect way of getting into the action and knowing the characters. One can also notice that Parzival is already a badass character, not a measly level 2 with no money that can not get out of the first planet without hitching a ride.

Once the race finishes and Parzival gets the key, he is immediately presented with the keyhole and the clue.
