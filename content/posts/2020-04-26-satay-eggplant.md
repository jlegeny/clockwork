After a long time a quick one.

This is a recipe for a nice and flavourful eggplant. It is quite fat and also salty so it's best eaten along with plain white rice.

# The Ingredients

We will need these:

![ingredients]

1. One eggplant
2. Few (4-5) cloves of garlic
3. A small onion
4. Dried garlic
5. Black pepper (or a mixture of pepper)
6. Salt (optional)
7. Oil
8. Soy sauce
9. Sesame oil
10. Rice wine
11. Satay sauce

# Preparation

The best taste is achieved when the eggplant is marinated for a couple of hours.

## Hacking and slashing

* Dice the eggplant into pieces of around 2-3 cm in size.
* Mince the garlic.
* Cut the onion into small dice. (This can be done a bit later).

## Pouring and shaking

* Mix the eggplant and the minced garlic.
* Add pepper.
* Add dried garlic.
* Optionally add salt, this really depends on how salty your soy sauce already is.
* Add satay sauce.
* Mix it all a bit.

![prep-1-cut-and-seasoned]

* Add oil, about 3-4 table spoons. Eggplant is like a sponge so it will soak it up pretty fast.
* Add the sesame oil, give the bottle a good shake, 10-15 drops at least.
* Add the soy sauce to taste.
* Add one cap of rice wine.

Culinary pro tip! Put plastic wrap over your bowl, put a plate over that. Then lift the bowl and shake the hell out of it.

This will make the ingredients mix very nicely.

Put the mixture in the fridge for about 2 hours.

# Cooking


* Put some oil in a pan, add the diced onions and cook them until transparent.

* Add in the prepared mixture and cook first on high, then on medium heat until the sauce becomes soupy and sticky.
