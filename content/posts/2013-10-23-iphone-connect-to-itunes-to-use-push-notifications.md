It seems that this message is randomly appearing for quite some people. It did for me when I updated to the iOS 7.0.3.

There are several solutions available on the internet including:

> Backup to iTunes Do factory reset Restore from Backup Re-install applications from appstore

Although this will probably work for everybody it is not the best of the solutions.

For me **disabling iCloud Keychain** was sufficient, hopefully it will be fixed soon.
