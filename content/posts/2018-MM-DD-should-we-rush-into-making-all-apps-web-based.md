[Betteridge's Law of Headlines][wp-betteridge] applies here and the answer is: no.

[wp-betteridge]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines

So, iOS 11.3 has [introduced the service workers API][ios-11.3-sw] (albeit somewhat [limited][ios-sw-limited]). Does this mean that we, the developers, should rush and make all of the new applications PWAs[^pwa]?

[^pwa]: A Progressive Web App, or a PWA is an application that can render as well in a browser tab as a standalone application. It can work offline and has access to the same functionalities as a native application would, in theory.
