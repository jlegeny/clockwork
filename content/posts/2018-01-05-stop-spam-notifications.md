I try to keep my notifications minimal. Only things that are somewhat important should get through.

But when I receive notifications like this my blood boils:

Amazon is not the sole culprit here. When I received several notifications from the Fork I have confronted them on Twitter. They have promised to do something about it, told me it is fixed, and then a few days later I was spammed again... with the same notification.

Although this is expressly forbidden by [Apple App Store Review Guidelines, Design section 4.5.3](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#apple-sites-and-services), big firms do not care.

I think the main problem comes from the fact that these cost nothing and are invisible to apple. I think we should be able to report these to Apple, in the same way it is done for spam e-mail.

# Where to put the report button?

Putting a button on each notification would be an overkill, also it would be probably too easy to hit it with a fat thumb.

Maybe it could go into the slide over menu in the notification center. But then notifications which just pop up while the phone is unlocked would get a free pass.
