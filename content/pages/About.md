I am a software developer at [Mensia Technologies](http://mensiatech.com)
working on software solutions for EEG signal processing. Mostly, I specialize
in C++ development and web technologies. I dabble in interface design.

I develop [Eventail](https://eventail.app), a compact calendar widget for iOS.

## Research

Some of my work involves doing science, so far I have two publications :

**Legény, J.**, Viciana Abad, R. & Lécuyer A., "Navigating in Virtual Worlds
Using a Self-Paced SSVEP-Based Brain-Compter Interface with Integrated
Stimulation and Real-Time Feedback", *Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual
Environments*, 20, pp. 529--544, (2011)
