This website is read only. I do not use any analytics beyond default web
server logs. This site stores no cookies and does not use any third party scripts.

One exception is that your visit will be logged by Google if you visit a page with an embedded YouTube player. I use the enhanced privacy mode for the YouTube embedded player.

The information that is kept:

- Your IP address at time of visit
- The time of your visit
- The address of the page you have visited
- Your user agent (what web browser you are using)
