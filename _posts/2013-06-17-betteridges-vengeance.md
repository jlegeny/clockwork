By Shaunacy Ferro, [Are Angry Legos Harming Our Children?][1]

> The paper estimates that on average, there are 75 Lego bricks for every person on Earth. "We cannot help but wonder how the move from only positive faces to an increasing number of negative faces impacts how children play," the researchers write. "The children that grow up with LEGO today will remember not only smileys, but also anger and fear in the Minifiguresâ€™ faces."

Another headline, another "no". I remember painting over the lego faces to give them any expression I wished them to have. Bad guys were quite angry.
