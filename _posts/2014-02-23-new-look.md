Update to a newer theme is now complete. Fonts should be nicer and faster on Apple hardware or anywhere with Helvetica Neue and Avenir installed. I have removed the web fonts as they were slowing down the site for no reason.

The mobile theme now works with Disqus. I have not figured out why it did not work in the previous one.

Code snippets are handled by [highlight.js][1] instead of the Syntax Highlighter. Code snippets also fit into their pre-defined frames and bounce on touch devices.

The "big" news is addition of my Instagram profile to the sidebar. Please go take a look, I promise not to post photos of my face or shoes. Cannot guarantee the amount of food pictures though.

I have several articles in the pipes. I will try to post more often.
